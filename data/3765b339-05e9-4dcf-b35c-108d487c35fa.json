    "original": "Here's a transcription of the visible text:\n\n๚ ๚ ೦ ರಾ ಶಿ ಷಿಂ  \n\nThis appears to be written in Kannada script.",
    "translation": "That's not Tamil; it's written in Kannada script.  The characters are difficult to interpret with certainty due to the quality of the image, but a possible reading is:\n\n**ರಾ ಶಿ ಷಿಂ (rā śi ṣiṁ)**\n\nThis could be interpreted as \"Rā Śi Ṣiṁ\"  which doesn't form a coherent phrase in Kannada or any other common Indian language that uses that script.  It might be an abbreviation, a name, or part of a larger inscription. More context is needed for accurate translation.\n"
